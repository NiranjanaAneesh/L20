    <h1>Addition</h1>
    <p>Addition (usually signified by the plus symbol +) is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, the other three
    being subtraction, multiplication and division.[2] The addition of two whole numbers results in the total amount or sum
    of those values combined. The example in the adjacent image shows two columns of three apples and two apples each,
    totaling at five apples. This observation is equivalent to the mathematical expression "3 + 2 = 5" (that is, "3 plus 2
    is equal to 5").
    
    Besides counting items, addition can also be defined and executed without referring to concrete objects, using
    abstractions called numbers instead, such as integers, real numbers and complex numbers. Addition belongs to arithmetic,
    a branch of mathematics. In algebra, another area of mathematics, addition can also be performed on abstract objects
    such as vectors, matrices, subspaces and subgroups.
    
    Addition has several important properties. It is commutative, meaning that the order of the operands does not matter,
    and it is associative, meaning that when one adds more than two numbers, the order in which addition is performed does
    not matter. Repeated addition of 1 is the same as counting (see Successor function). Addition of 0 does not change a
    number. Addition also obeys rules concerning related operations such as subtraction and multiplication.
    
    Performing addition is one of the simplest numerical tasks to do. Addition of very small numbers is accessible to
    toddlers; the most basic task, 1 + 1, can be performed by infants as young as five months, and even some members of
    other animal species. In primary education, students are taught to add numbers in the decimal system, starting with
    single digits and progressively tackling more difficult problems. Mechanical aids range from the ancient abacus to the
    modern computer, where research on the most efficient implementations of addition continues to this day.</p>
