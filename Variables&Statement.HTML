    <h1>Addition</h1>
    <p>Addition is combining two or more numbers together to get a new total. The symbol used in addition problems looks like a
    cross, +, and is called a plus sign. The total for addition is called the sum. Other common words used in addition
    problems are add, plus, combine, together, total, in all, and increase.</p>
    <p id="result"></p>
    <script>
        var num1 = 2;
        var num2 = 2;
        var sum = num1 + num2;

        document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Total sum is: " + sum;
    </script>

    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>
    <p>A JavaScript statement is a piece of code that tells a computer or browser to perform an action. JavaScript statements
    can be simple or complex, and can include values, operators, expressions, keywords, and comments.
    Here are some examples of JavaScript statements:
    Assignment statements: Assign values to variables that have already been declared. For example, myName = "Jane".
    Declaration statements: Create variables. For example, let bestColor.
    Expression statements: Use almost any expression as a statement. For example, console.log("Hello").
    Conditional statements: Control program flow. For example, if.
    New statements: Create new objects. For example, let myInstance = new MyObject(params).
    JavaScript statements are executed in the order they are written in a program. Semicolons (;) are used to separate
    statements, but they are not required at the end of each statement.</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>

        var x, y, z; //These are the variables
        x = 1; //The value of the variable x is 1
        y = 2; //The value of the variable y is 2
        z = x + y; //The sum of variables x and y is equal to z
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The value of z is " + z + ".";
